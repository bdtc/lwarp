# lwarp
The lwarp package for LaTeX â€” Converts LaTeX documents to HTML.

TeX is used to drive the conversion, resulting in deep compatibility with feature-rich print documents.  A LuaTeX utility assembles the resulting text and images into HTML and SVG files.

Has programmed support for more than 500 LaTeX packages and classes, of which more than 90 also support MathJax.  Numerous other packages work with lwarp as-is, as well, especially those related to plain text, math, or graphics.

Math may be represented by MathJax, with equation numbers matching the print document; or by SVG images, with ALT tags which include the LaTeX source for the math expression.

Includes a quick-start tutorial, an extensive manual, a large troubleshooting index, built-in diagnostics, and error messages with helpful advice.
