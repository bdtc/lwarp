# lwarp
The lwarp package for LaTeX â€” Converts LaTeX documents to HTML.

TeX is used to drive the conversion, resulting in deep compatibility with feature-rich print documents.  A LuaTeX utility assembles the resulting text and images into HTML and SVG files.

Math may be represented by MathJax, with equation numbers matching the print document; or by SVG images, with ALT tags which include the LaTeX source for the math expression.
